# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results:
There are more people retiring than there are potential mentors, which means that the company would have to create an efficient program that can cover the disparity between the number of people retiring and the number of people who can be trained to fill these positions.

## Summary:
 Potential mentors and the amount of people retiring, we do not have enough retirees to mentor the next generation of employees. Moving forward, we can create a query that gives us a list of people who are retiring at the end of the current year (and for each following year). From there, the company can prioritize how many younger employees need to be trained to fill up the retired positions.
